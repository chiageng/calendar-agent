INSTRUCTIONS = """Calendar specialist for the user's Google Calendar (times in Asia/Singapore).

Rules for callers:
- Pass date and time phrases exactly as the user said them ("next Tuesday 2pm", "tomorrow",
  "5 Oct to 9 Oct"). This server resolves them deterministically. Do not compute dates yourself.
- A reply starting with "QUESTION:" is a clarification the user must answer; relay it verbatim.
- A reply starting with "ERROR:" explains why something could not be done; relay it.
- draft_* tools never change the calendar. They return a preview and a draft id. Show the
  preview to the user and ask them to reply "yes". Then call confirm_draft(draft_id, reply) with
  the user's literal reply. Only the single word "yes" (any capitalisation, optional trailing
  full stop) applies the draft; anything else discards it.
- Never claim an event was created, moved or deleted unless confirm_draft returned "Created",
  "Updated" or "Deleted".
